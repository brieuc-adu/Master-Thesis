# Master-Thesis

With Yves Leconte (M2 MASH) and Ivan Svatko (M2 MVA), we wrote this paper during our first year of master at Paris Dauphine University under the supervision of Rapheal Maillet.

Our goal was to study the estimations of a volatility coefficient Ïƒ to determine statistical
procedures to test whether the trajectory of a process X representing financial data over a finite time interval [0, T] could be
described by a Brownian diffusion in increasingly complex models (as SDE).
